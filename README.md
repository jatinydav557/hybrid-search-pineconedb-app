# 🤖 Hybrid Search RAG Chatbot using Pinecone, LangChain & Groq

This project showcases a **powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that uses **hybrid search** powered by **Pinecone's dense + sparse vector search**, **Hugging Face embeddings**, **BM25 encoding**, and **Groq’s LLMs (LLaMA-3)**. Built using **LangChain** and **Streamlit**, this app simulates a real-world AI-powered question-answering system for AI-related topics.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Many chatbots rely on either dense or sparse retrieval — but not both. This project integrates **hybrid retrieval** using **Pinecone** and **BM25** alongside **dense embeddings**, making it more accurate and resilient, especially for niche queries. It's ideal for scenarios like:

- Knowledge base Q&A  
- Search-powered assistant apps  
- Learning bots for tech content  
- Personal assistants trained on custom corpora

## 🧠 Features

✅ **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines semantic search (dense) + keyword-based (sparse) retrieval using Pinecone.

✅ **Custom AI Corpus**: Ingested text on AI concepts, machine learning, RAG, LLMs, etc.

✅ **Groq Integration**: Supercharged LLM inference with Groq’s blazing-fast LLaMA-3 model.

✅ **Streamlit Frontend**: Clean chat UI with expandable source documents.

✅ **Environment Secured**: All secrets stored in a `.env` file and loaded securely.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hybrid-rag-chatbot.git
cd hybrid-rag-chatbot
````

### 2. Install Dependencies (using uv or pip)

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add API Keys in `.env`

```env
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 💬 How It Works

1. Loads embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and BM25 encoder.
2. Ingests AI-related corpus into Pinecone with hybrid vectorization.
3. User enters a question → hybrid retriever fetches top results.
4. LangChain’s RAG pipeline uses Groq's LLM to answer.
5. UI displays the result along with source context for transparency.

## 🔍 Example Query

**Q:** What is RAG in AI?

**A:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines external knowledge retrieval with generation capabilities to produce grounded and context-aware responses. It improves accuracy by sourcing relevant documents before answering.
